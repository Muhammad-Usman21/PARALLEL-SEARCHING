Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie. Every detective must solve a mystery. The only way to do great work is to love what you do; love for your work is essential. Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. Creativity is intelligence having fun. Fun can spark creativity. To be or not to be, that is the question. The question of existence.
